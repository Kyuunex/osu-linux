# osu-linux
This repo exists because I got tried of typing out every time to someone how to run osu! on Linux perfectly, 
with everything working. 
What makes this repo different form other, hundreds of tutorials on the internet about this topic is that 
I personally run osu regularly and what is written here is what I have validated to work at the time you are reading it, 
meaning that I keep this repo up to date in case something changes.

## The easiest way to get osu! (stable) running on Linux is by using Lutris
If you choose this approach, after making sure you have Lutris installed,
Head over [here](https://lutris.net/games/osu/), and click on the last install script, and follow it.
After that, [lower the PulseAudio latency](https://github.com/Kyuunex/osu-linux/tree/main/pulseaudio-lower-latency.md) 
by following the appropriate guide bellow or read the 
[PulseAudio vs ALSA](https://github.com/Kyuunex/osu-linux/tree/main/pulseaudio-vs-alsa.md) guide.

Of course, being the easiest does not make Lutris the best approach, it's the one you pick if you want to
just play the game don't want to and put any effort into doing so. Bellow there are more advanced guides.

## Tablet Drivers
I recommend [OpenTabletDriver](https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver/wiki/Installation-Guide#linux)
