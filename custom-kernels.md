# Custom kernels
As far as I know, the stock Linux kernel is not tailored specifically for gaming, 
it is much more generalized to work well on servers etc. But since it's open-source, 
there are custom ones made to be optimized for more desktop related loads, such as gaming.

## does it make a difference?
It's one thing to measure the effectiveness of something using a tool/benchmark that tells you the number, 
and it's another thing when you sit down to your computer and experience the difference 
without relying on a benchmark/number to tell you how happy you should be.  

For me, at least on Ubuntu/Debian, installing Liquorix did make stuttering happen much less often.  

So, what I'm saying is, give these a try and see if they help with getting rid of stuttering if you have them.
